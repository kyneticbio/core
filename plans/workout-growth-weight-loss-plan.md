okay so I want to use this app to help me start working out.. I'm audhd, and i've been using the app so far to help me shift my circadian rhythm earlier, feel more consstent energy and focus, eat less sugar.. and i think that's mostly it so far.. here's my supplements so far: 6:45am (fasted)

L-Theanine — Promotes calm, focused alertness without sedation. Takes the edge off morning activation/anxiety common with ADHD. Smooths out stimulants (caffeine, adderall) if you take them.

L-Carnitine 1000mg — Supports cellular energy production and mental clarity. Morning timing helps establish "on" mode for your circadian system.

10K Lux Light Exposure — Down regulates melatonin, reducing grogginess, helps signal “wake” for circadian system.

9am with breakfast

D3 5,000 IU — Morning light-spectrum vitamin. Reinforces circadian "daytime" signaling. Also supports mood regulation — low D3 is common in ADHD/autism.

Zinc + Copper — Zinc is critical for dopamine synthesis and regulation. Often depleted with ADHD. Copper is included because chronic zinc supplementation can create copper deficiency.

B12/Folate — Methylation support and neurotransmitter synthesis. MTHFR variants (common in neurodivergent folks) impair folate metabolism — methylated forms bypass this.

P-5-P 50mg — Active B6. Direct cofactor for synthesizing dopamine, serotonin, and GABA. Foundational for everything else in your stack.

Chromium 200mcg — Blood sugar stabilization and craving reduction (especially carbs). Directly supports your diet management goal. Also helps with ADHD impulsive eating patterns.

Digestive enzymes — Improves nutrient absorption. Gut issues are overrepresented in autism. Better digestion = better uptake of everything else you're taking.

Rhodiola 200-400mg — Adaptogen supporting focus and stress resilience. Mildly pro-dopaminergic without overstimulation. Helps with ADHD fatigue.

CDP Choline 250-500mg — Acetylcholine precursor for attention and working memory. Synergizes with your dopamine support.

2pm energy boost

DOPA Mucuna OR L-Tyrosine + L-Carnitine — Both address the afternoon dopamine dip common in ADHD.

Mucuna contains actual L-DOPA (more direct, stronger)

L-Tyrosine is a precursor (gentler, more sustainable)

Rotating makes sense to avoid receptor downregulation. The afternoon timing targets the classic ADHD "wall."

Now - I haven't worked out in years.. and I'm interested in starting. I have a brand new apartment I'm moving into tomorrow morning and I want to start my routines right.. and I want to use my interest and excitement with this system to help me start projecting how different activities I do could improve my health, lose weight. and gain muscle tone. Losing weight actually is the biggest goal - though starting to build muscle is interesting for me too - especially since i'm eating a high protien/fat diet now.

So.. what kinds of interventions, and signals should I really be looking at? I want a comprehensive set of things that can be virtualized that are all about weight loss and muscle synthesis.

Some things i'm thinkng about are like:

a signal for weight where food and exercise effect it, and then when i sumulate over 30 days i could see the weight slowly going down.. and a signal for BMI, BMR.. and maybe calorie balance (which would essentially be the weight, right? like.. maybe starting weight would be whatever I put in as the subject.. and the weight would drop based on the BMR.. and then interventions like working out and eating would essentially use a CICO method?

and then.. maybe based on macros we could focus on things like HGH, and other weight loss and growth signals and stuff..
